ok really good, close! but not quite. I hate that you make me type in a file name. and also, you cant toggle/disable WHOLE FOLDERS AND THEIR CHILDREN. thats so important. I want to be able to drill down to a folder and toggle its inclusion easily, files too, just by clocking the little check mark to the left of it. folders should have check marks to their left TOO, just like files. 

Also, its great that youc an use space bar to toggle expand all/collapse all, and select all/deselect all, but you should be able to do that just by CLICKING them too. so for those two top level things, clicking them toggles them. for the other options in the include panel, you click them to select them, and if you click them WHILE selected, thats a toggle. and if you click again, toggle. etc. remove the "type the name" bullshit for includsions. also lets add a "reset selection" toggle to just reset all selections and clear everything as if it was opened for the first time. 

lets also add a section in include (separated/organized) that detects all file types and lets you mass toggle those file types too. so like all *.rs or all *.js or *.toml or whatever is included. and by default it sorts by the greatest number of file types so if its like 90% rust files, the first file type is likely going to be *.rs etc

also you eliminated scroll in the preview tree, it was nice using the mouse wheel on that. 

 i noticed "tests" selects things that have test(s?) in the file name, but also it should detect if there is a FOLDER named tests (not sure if thats already the case).
